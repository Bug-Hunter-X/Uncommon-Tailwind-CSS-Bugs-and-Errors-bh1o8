The Tailwind CSS framework might produce unexpected results if you have conflicting or poorly structured CSS rules.  For example, using classes with overlapping specificity can cause styles to be overridden unintentionally.  Another common issue is forgetting to purge unused CSS classes in your production build, which leads to bloated CSS files.  Incorrectly configured plugin options can also lead to unexpected behavior. Finally, the use of conflicting utility classes on the same HTML element could result in unexpected visual outcomes.
